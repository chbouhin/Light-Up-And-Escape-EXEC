# Light-Up-And-Escape

# GAMEPLAY

- This is a 2D puzzle platform game, you will control 2 characters and need both of them.
- You control a slime (the square) and a firefly (the round light).
- The goal is to reach the end of a level by collecting as many coins as possible and avoiding dying.

# HOW TO START THE GAME ?

# BASIC RULE:

- The firefly can activate the buttons.
- The slime can carry boxes and keys.
- The 2 characters cannot cross the walls except some special walls that can only be crossed by one of the 2 characters.
- 2 types of monsters will be on your way, they only attack one of your characters, it's up to you to differentiate them.
- Floor plates can also be activated by putting weight on them (via a box, a monster, or your slime)
- When you turn on a device, it may open/close a door and/or a light.

# DEVLOPEMENT:

I developed the game alone in my free time in 2 months.

Most of the assets (sounds and images) were retrieved from the unity store, but for the most part I had to create or modify them.
